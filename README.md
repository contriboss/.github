### What is Contriboss?

A curated registry of open source developers and projects that actually ship and maintain real solutions. Contriboss cuts through the noise of bot-generated charts, zombie forks, and hollow stars.

### Why Contriboss?

* **Authenticity Over Metrics**
  Real-world impact > vanity counts.
* **Trusted Discovery**
  Organizations find builders who deliver, not resume-padders.
* **Community-Driven Credibility**
  Verified by peers and transparent data.

### Features at a Glance

* **Verified Maintainers**
  Peer-vetted and data-backed profiles.
* **Project Tags**
  Domain, usage level, license, language.
* **Contriboss Badge**
  A mark of genuine commitment to open source.
* **Hall of Shame**
  A light-hearted spotlight on ghosted projects and zombie forks.
* **Sponsor & Support Links**
  Connections to GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, or consulting.

### How It Works
